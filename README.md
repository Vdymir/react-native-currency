# Currency info

Hello, thank you in advance for taking the time to review my project, it means a lot to me and I would appreciate any feedback.

For the test there were many doubts, what design to do? What data to show? What kind of filter should I apply?
I have done everything based on what I think is best.


### Implementations (PLEASE README) üìã

Although this test did not require many needs, I have tried not to use libraries, I CAN DO IT ALL MYSELF, and I think I have succeeded ü§©.

Because the project was short, many questions arose
Do I use a global state handler?
The app is too small to use it
But what if the application grows in the future?
Questions like these come up all the time.

The same happened with the folder structure.
Do I organize it by modules?
The app is too small to implement it
But what if it grows? It's better by modules.

And so I could continue with many more options, once again, I have done what I think is convenient.

Finally, I want to say that I have done integration with java and swift to create native modules üòâ.
